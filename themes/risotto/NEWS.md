# risotto (development version)

* **Breaking change:** The config parameter `logo` now expects a character, e.g. an emoji or Unicode symbol.
  * For the old behaviour, use `logo_image`
* Fixed invalid HTML in header nav
* Added RSS feed references to head element (thanks @frankenstein91, #73, after <https://gohugo.io/templates/rss/>)
* Added [OpenGraph](https://ogp.me/) metadata to head element (thanks @marcoagpegoraro, #77)
* Updated FontAwesome to 6.6.0 (thanks @suyaseongi, #88)
  * Please note that future versions will probably not include FontAwesome by default (#59)
* Fixed deprecated config syntax for pagination (thanks @kratzert, #94)


# risotto 0.4.0

* Added descriptions to sidebar of list pages, where defined in the frontmatter of `_index.md` (#55)
* Made sidebar sticky, avoiding overflow for long tables of contents (thanks @dasvh, #51)
* Added convenience classes for colours, e.g. `.base00` and `.bg-base00`.
* Fixed overflow of code blocks with line numbers (#41)
* Fixed invalid HTML in page header (thanks @garlic0x1, #64)
* Updated FontAwesome to 6.5.1 (thanks @ghost, #63)
  * Please note that future versions will probably not include FontAwesome by default (#59)
* Updated Academicons to 1.9.4 (thanks @ghost, #63)
  * Please note that future versions will probably not include Academicons by default (#59)

# risotto 0.3.0

* Added support for favicons (#57)

# risotto 0.2.0

* **Breaking change** â€“ new framework for colour palettes:
  * Palettes are defined using CSS variables following the [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) system
  * Added 14 new palettes: `apprentice`, `base16-dark`, `base16-light`, `dracula`, `material`, `papercolor-dark`, `papercolor-light`, `solarized-dark`, `solarized-light`, `tender`, `tokyo-night-dark`, `tokyo-night-light`, `windows-95` and `windows-95-light`.
  * The default palette is `base16-dark`
  * The `mode` parameter is no longer needed
  * If you were using one of the old named palettes (`gruvbox-dark` or `gruvbox-light`), the change will be seamless.
  * If you were using a custom palette, you will need to redefine it using the new framework. See README for further details.
* Added a table of contents (thanks @dashv, #47)
* Added multilanguage support with a language switcher (thanks @bedefaced)
* Made the site header and nav wrap more efficiently on narrow screens (thanks @m-dev672, #32)
* Added a changelog

# risotto 0.1.0

* `gruvbox-dark` and `gruvbox-light` colour palettes
